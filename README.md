## Overview
This repository hosts the design and implementation of the CS5343 Audio Input Expansion Module. The module integrates the CS5343, a high-performance audio ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), suitable for high-quality audio recording and processing applications. It connects to the mainboard via a standard I2S interface, enabling digital audio capture at high sample rates.

## Key Features of CS5343
- **High-Quality Audio ADC**: Captures pristine audio quality with minimal noise.
- **Supports High Sample Rates**: Up to 192 kHz, allowing for studio-grade audio recording.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized for efficient operation, minimizing power requirements.
- **Digital Output**: I2S interface for straightforward integration with microcontrollers and DSPs.
- **Compact Size**: Small footprint for easy inclusion in various designs.
